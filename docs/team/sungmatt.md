### Project: ManageHR

ManageHR is your all-in-one solution for seamless Human Resources management. Say goodbye to paperwork, spreadsheets, and administrative headaches. Our cutting-edge software empowers HR professionals to focus on what truly matters â€“ your people.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: 
Enhancement to the help function.
  * What it does: allows the user to quickly see how a command is used, and get an example in the clipboard to easily try.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly for beginner users as they are able to check the usage of a command.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of all commands. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()
